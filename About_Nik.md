# Hello prospective employer or lost internet stranger!

**This document exists to give a better representation of my previous work experience (relevant to programming) and software engineering prowess, as well as a peek into whose GitHub repository you're looking at.** 

It's a busy world we live in and as such I don't have quite as much time as I'd like to work on side projects outside of work. That being the case most of my coding experience and improvement happens at work on projects I'm not allowed to share. I still want to give you an idea of the work I have done and what I have worked with/on.

## Background

Education: 
* Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering from the University of Northern Colorado class of 2018.

Work experience:
* QA for DISH Technologies official title being Software Analyst I
  * August 2018 - Current

Languages:
* Python - Perhaps my favorite language. I have worked in both 2.7 and 3.
* Java - I would say most of my early schooling was focused on Java
  * side note: Processing is a very fun Java language
* C# - More of my later schooling focused on C#
  * Some of my school projects can be found in this repo!
* SQL - My database management course was surprisingly one of my favorites
  * "Types" of sql I've worked with:
    * MySQL, SQLite3
    * Big Data - Hive, Impala
* Groovy - Gained exposure to Groovy in my use of Katalon Studio making automated GUI tests
* Git - Absolutely critical. Life before versioning systems had to have been a mess.
* Ruby - This is the newest language to me. 
  * Most of my exposure has been gaining an understanding of anothers code and fixing/refactoring what I can.
   

## Work

### QA for DISH Technologies

This job has certainly been trial by fire and has tested me in several different fields. At the beginning of my employment I worked with the QA team to help develop automated tests for the companies website. Coming into this job I had no prior experience with Katalon Studio, Selenium or Groovy. Nonetheless, I was able to pick it up pretty quickly and helped create the framework we used for testing as well as automated tests themselves.

Roughly 3 months into this position my skills were required elsewhere and I was absorbed into the QA side of the metadata team. This position has me spread out in different areas in areas I knew little about and has really pushed my abilities. I have learned a lot in this position and really enjoy it. I deal with a lot of automated testing of both data and set top boxes. As QA a lot of what I develop is built along side developers to serve as a check for the work they do. From here its probably easiest to just give a brief outline of what I've done.

Website GUI Automation
* Worked with Katalon Studio 
* Wrote automated test cases in Groovy
* Verified data on backend and frontend
* Languages:
  * Groovy
  * Katalon works on top of Selenium

Data Verification Automation 
* Write and maintain code that verifies data (see some examples)
  * Verifying amounts of data are in expected thresholds
  * Verifying data is as its expected (JSON schemas, file types, MD5 checksums, etc...)
  * Languages:
    * Python
    * Ruby
    * Bash Shell
* Automation of automated tests
  * Work with Jenkins to schedule and pipeline tasks/tests
  * Work with Airflow writing DAGs (python)
* Big Data
  * Validation of databases containing millions of records
  * Calculation of deltas (deletes, inserts, updates)
  * Languages:
    * Hive
    * Impala
    * Python
    * Shell
* File validation
  * Watch over file creation, editing and pipeline 
  * Ensure set top boxes handle data appropriately
  * Ensure all necessary data is there
  * Requires a lot of debugging and error catching
* Networking
  * Setting up and maintaining racks of set top boxes
  * Testing of networking changes to detect problems before they're problems
