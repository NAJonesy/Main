## Cache Replacement

This project was made to demonstrate my understanding of different cache-memory replacement algorithms. This reflects different ways an operating system may replace pages in cache-memory.

### Pattern length
This variable is the length of the pattern that will be created. Entry must be between 10 and 100.

### Unique Pages
This variable is the number of different "pages" that are going to fill a slot of memory. These pages will be represented by the letters A-J. Entry must be between 2 and 10.

### Slots
This variable will represent the number of memory slots available. Each slot can hold one "page" at a time. Entry must be between 2 and 10.
