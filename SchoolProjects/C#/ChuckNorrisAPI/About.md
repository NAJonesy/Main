# API Project

This project tested my knowledge of APIs. I built this project in Visual Studio as a WPF application in c#. I chose to connect my program to the API of Chuck Norris Jokes Api <https://api.chucknorris.io/>. The api responds in Json and I had to display that information through my program.
